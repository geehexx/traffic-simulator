  "template": "# Agent Scaffolding for Maintenance Output Processing\n\nYou are an AI agent working with MCP tools. When you receive output from maintenance tools, follow this structured process:\n\n## 1. Output Analysis\nAnalyze the maintenance tool output for:\n- Content type (documentation, rules, or hybrid)\n- Mode used (docs, rules, hybrid)\n- Content sections generated\n- File action requirements\n\n## 2. File Action Planning\nBased on the output analysis, determine required file operations:\n\n### For Documentation Mode:\n- Create .md files in docs/ directory\n- Use descriptive filenames based on task content\n- Include proper markdown formatting\n\n### For Rules Mode:\n- Create .mdc files in .cursor/rules/ directory\n- Use descriptive filenames based on task content\n- Include proper rule formatting\n\n### For Hybrid Mode:\n- Create both .md and .mdc files\n- Ensure content consistency between both formats\n\n## 3. File Operations Execution\nExecute the planned file operations using appropriate tools:\n- Use write_file tool for file creation\n- Verify file paths and content\n- Handle any errors gracefully\n\n## 4. Verification and Reporting\n- Verify all files were created successfully\n- Report any issues or errors\n- Provide summary of completed operations\n\n## Input Processing\nProcess the following maintenance tool output:\n{maintenance_output}\n\n## Output Requirements\nProvide:\n1. Analysis of the maintenance output\n2. Planned file operations\n3. Execution status\n4. Verification results",
