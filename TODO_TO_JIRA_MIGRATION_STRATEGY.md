# TODO to JIRA Migration Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the strategic approach for migrating the traffic-simulator project from a TODO-based task management system to a comprehensive JIRA-based project management solution.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing TODO System
- **ROADMAP.md**: High-level phase tracking with manual checkboxes
- **Scattered Tasks**: Development tasks distributed across code comments and documentation
- **Limited Visibility**: No centralized progress tracking or analytics
- **Manual Management**: No automated reporting or team coordination

### Challenges with Current System
- **Lack of Centralization**: Tasks spread across multiple files and locations
- **No Progress Tracking**: Difficult to measure completion rates and velocity
- **Limited Collaboration**: No structured workflow for team coordination
- **Manual Reporting**: Time-consuming to generate project status reports

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Automated TODO Scanning
```python
# scripts/scan_todos.py
def scan_codebase_for_todos():
    """Scan entire codebase for TODO comments"""
    todos = []
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk("."):
        for file in files:
            if file.endswith(('.py', '.md', '.yaml', '.yml')):
                file_path = os.path.join(root, file)
                todos.extend(extract_todos_from_file(file_path))
    return todos

def extract_todos_from_file(file_path):
    """Extract TODO comments from a single file"""
    todos = []
    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        for line_num, line in enumerate(f, 1):
            if 'TODO' in line or 'FIXME' in line or 'HACK' in line:
                todos.append({
                    'file': file_path,
                    'line': line_num,
                    'text': line.strip(),
                    'type': determine_todo_type(line)
                })
    return todos
```

### 2. JIRA Issue Creation
```python
# scripts/create_jira_issues.py
def create_jira_issue_from_todo(todo):
    """Create JIRA issue from TODO comment"""
    issue_data = {
        "project": "TRAFFIC",
        "issuetype": determine_issue_type(todo),
        "summary": clean_todo_text(todo['text']),
        "description": f"Auto-created from TODO in {todo['file']}:{todo['line']}",
        "customfield_10001": determine_phase(todo),  # Phase field
        "customfield_10002": determine_component(todo),  # Component field
        "priority": determine_priority(todo),
    }
    return jira_client.create_issue(issue_data)
```

### 3. Automated Migration
```python
# scripts/migrate_todos_to_jira.py
def migrate_all_todos():
    """Migrate all TODOs to JIRA issues"""
    todos = scan_codebase_for_todos()
    created_issues = []

    for todo in todos:
        try:
            issue = create_jira_issue_from_todo(todo)
            created_issues.append(issue)
            print(f"Created issue {issue.key} for TODO in {todo['file']}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Failed to create issue for TODO in {todo['file']}: {e}")

    return created_issues
```
