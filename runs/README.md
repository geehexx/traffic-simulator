# Runs Directory

This directory contains all profiling, benchmarking, and performance analysis output files generated by the traffic simulation project.

## Directory Structure

## File Types

- **CSV Files**: Performance metrics, profiling data, benchmark results
- **JSON Files**: Configuration and analysis results
- **HTML Reports**: Performance reports and visualizations
- **Flame Graphs**: Performance profiling visualizations

## Usage

All profiling and benchmarking scripts automatically save their output to this directory. The directory structure is organized by analysis type:

- `profiling/` - Detailed performance profiling data
- `benchmarks/` - Benchmark test results
- `performance/` - Performance analysis and optimization results
- `scaling/` - Scaling behavior analysis
- `coverage/` - Test coverage reports and HTML output
- `quality/` - Quality analysis reports and metrics

## Git Ignore

This entire directory is ignored by git to prevent committing large data files and generated outputs. Only the directory structure and this README are tracked.

## Scripts That Use This Directory

- `scripts/benchmarking_framework.py` - Main benchmarking framework
- `scripts/advanced_profiling.py` - Advanced profiling analysis
- `scripts/external_tools.py` - External tool integration
- `scripts/quality_analysis.py` - Quality analysis and reporting
- All performance and profiling scripts

## Configuration

The base directory is configured in `config/benchmarking.yaml`:

```yaml
output:
  base_directory: "runs"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always use the runs directory** for any profiling/benchmark output
2. **Organize files by type** using the subdirectory structure
3. **Use descriptive filenames** with timestamps when appropriate
4. **Clean up old files** periodically to save disk space
5. **Document any custom analysis** in the appropriate subdirectory
