# DSPy-Based Automated Prompt Engineering (APE) Methodologies {#id:ape-methodologies}

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive methodologies for DSPy-based Automated Prompt Engineering (APE) integrated into the MCP server for maintaining documentation and rules for the traffic simulator project. The system uses DSPy's structured approach with Signatures, Modules, and Optimizers to provide systematic prompt optimization with continuous learning capabilities.

## Theoretical Foundation

### DSPy-Based Prompt Engineering Principles
- **Structured Signatures**: Define clear input/output specifications for all prompt tasks
- **DSPy Modules**: Use ChainOfThought, ReAct, and other reasoning modules for systematic processing
- **Automatic Optimization**: Leverage BootstrapFewShot, joint optimization, and Bayesian optimizers
- **Performance Metrics**: Systematic evaluation with improvement scoring and tracking
- **Continuous Learning**: Automated optimization cycles with self-improvement capabilities

### Academic References

## Core Methodologies

### 1. Candidate Generation Strategy

#### Structural Variation
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Vary section ordering and nesting depth
- **Gate Placement**: Position decision points and validation gates differently
- **Mode Explicitness**: Vary how clearly modes (docs/rules/hybrid) are defined

#### Brevity vs. Thoroughness Trade-offs
- **Concise Variants**: Focus on essential instructions with minimal examples
- **Comprehensive Variants**: Include detailed procedures and edge case handling
- **Balanced Variants**: Moderate detail with strategic examples

#### Targeting Specificity
- **Broad Scope**: Universal rules with `globs: "**"` and `alwaysApply: true`
- **Precise Scope**: File-specific rules with targeted glob patterns
- **Hybrid Scope**: Category rules with moderate specificity

### 2. Evaluation Framework

#### Primary Rubrics
- **PDQI-9 (Documentation)**: 45 points across 9 dimensions
  - Accuracy, Thoroughness, Clarity, Consistency, Relevance
  - Organization, Timeliness, Efficiency, Engagement
- **RGS (Rules)**: 100 points across 6 dimensions
  - Clarity & Actionability (25), Token Efficiency (20)
  - Maintainability (20), Context Relevance (15)
  - Documentation Quality (10), Completeness (10)

#### Global Cross-Cutting Metrics
- **Idempotency Score**: Stable anchors, reproducible ordering, minimal unrelated changes
- **Stability Index**: 1 - normalized stddev across minor-perturbation runs
- **Duplication/SoT Score**: Penalize content overlap, reward canonical consolidation
- **Cross-Reference Integrity**: Links resolve correctly, policy compliance
- **Link Hygiene**: Valid links, appropriate `mdc:` references, `runs/` for outputs
- **API Validity**: Verify Arcade functions exist and have correct signatures

### 3. Stability Testing Protocol

#### Perturbation Harness
- **Input Variations**: Minor changes to standardized inputs (5-10% variation)
- **Seeded Randomness**: Consistent perturbations across candidates
- **Multiple Runs**: 3-5 iterations per candidate
- **Threshold**: Winners must achieve Stability Index ≥0.85

#### Stability Calculation
```
Stability Index = 1 - (normalized_stddev / mean_score)
```

### 4. Human-in-the-Loop Integration

#### HITL Checkpoints
- **Candidate Shortlist**: Human review of top 2-3 candidates
- **Tie-Breaking**: When candidates are within epsilon (≤2 points)
- **Consolidation Decisions**: Merges affecting Single Source of Truth
- **Lessons Learned**: Post-selection feedback integration

#### Decision Memos
- **Qualitative Notes**: Why the winner was preferred
- **Edge Cases**: New scenarios discovered during evaluation
- **Prompt Refinements**: Concrete edits to improve future candidates
- **Metric Updates**: Adjustments to scoring rubrics based on experience

## Advanced Techniques

### Token Strategy for Large Contexts
- **Priority Ordering**: Keep decisions, criteria, diffs, and links
- **Winner Preservation**: Retain winning candidates, truncate lower-ranked
- **Fingerprint Retention**: Maintain hashes for determinism
- **Context Pruning**: Remove verbose logs while preserving essential information

### Consolidation Intelligence
- **Similarity Detection**: Compute overlap between existing content
- **Canonical Selection**: Choose authoritative source for merged content
- **Cross-Reference Updates**: Update all inbound links to new locations
- **Redirect Management**: Maintain aliases where supported

### Link Policy Enforcement
- **Documentation**: Must not link to rule files
- **Rules**: May link to docs and other rules
- **Prompts**: Exempt from restrictions, may reference both
- **Validation**: Automated checking of link direction compliance

## Practical Implementation

### Standardized Inputs
- **Git Signals**: Branch, HEAD, baseline, status, diffs, log history
- **Change Inventory**: Affected paths with relevant hunks
- **Decisions**: Chat/issue notes, requirements, acceptance criteria
- **Style Guides**: Documentation patterns, quality standards
- **Constraints**: Link policies, security requirements, performance targets

### Dry-Run Protocol
- **In-Memory Execution**: No file writes until winner selected
- **Parallel Evaluation**: Run all candidates on identical inputs
- **Scoring Consistency**: Use same rubrics and metrics across candidates
- **Stability Testing**: Apply perturbation harness to all candidates

### Winner Selection Process
1. **Absolute Scoring**: Apply PDQI-9/RGS and global metrics
2. **Pairwise Ranking**: Bradley-Terry/Elo on identical inputs
3. **Stability Verification**: Ensure Stability Index ≥0.85
4. **HITL Review**: Human input for ties and edge cases
5. **Final Selection**: Choose most stable and concise if tied

## Quality Assurance

### Positive Examples
- **Concise Consolidation**: Merge overlapping content with stable anchors
- **Minimal Churn**: Preserve unrelated content formatting
- **Clear Structure**: Logical organization with consistent headings
- **Proper References**: Valid links with appropriate scope

### Negative Examples
- **Time-Bound Claims**: Avoid phase-specific or project-specific details
- **Policy Violations**: Documentation linking to rule files
- **Unstable Headings**: Non-deterministic anchor generation
- **Over-Broad Rules**: Too many global rules (>5)

### Common Pitfalls
- **Token Overruns**: Exceeding soft cap without justification
- **Redundant Content**: Repeating information across files
- **Broken Links**: References that don't resolve correctly
- **Inconsistent Formatting**: Mixed heading styles or list formats

## Integration with Meta-Optimizer

### Context Provision
- **Methodology References**: Link to specific APE techniques
- **Rubric Details**: Provide scoring criteria and weights
- **Example Cases**: Positive and negative examples for guidance
- **Constraint Enforcement**: Automated policy compliance checking

### Feedback Loop
- **Lessons Learned**: Capture qualitative insights from HITL sessions
- **Prompt Refinements**: Update candidate generation based on experience
- **Metric Adjustments**: Modify scoring based on effectiveness
- **Stability Improvements**: Enhance perturbation harness based on results

## Maintenance and Evolution
