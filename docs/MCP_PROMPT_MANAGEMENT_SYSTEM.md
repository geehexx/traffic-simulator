# MCP Prompt Management System with Scaffolding

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive documentation for the implementation of an MCP (Model Context Protocol) prompt management system with scaffolding for file operations within the Traffic Simulator project.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Prompt Management System**
   - Centralized prompt storage and retrieval
   - Version control for prompt templates
   - Optimization and improvement tracking

2. **Scaffolding System**
   - Output processing and analysis
   - File operation planning and execution
   - Error handling and verification

3. **File Operations**
   - Automated file creation based on content type
   - Proper directory structure maintenance
   - Content formatting and validation

## Implementation Details

### Prompt Management

The system manages prompts through:
- **Template Storage**: JSON-based prompt templates
- **Version Control**: Track prompt changes and optimizations
- **Execution Engine**: Process prompts with input data
- **Output Handling**: Manage prompt outputs and results

### Scaffolding Integration

The scaffolding system provides:
- **Output Analysis**: Determine content type and requirements
- **File Planning**: Plan appropriate file operations
- **Execution**: Create files with proper structure
- **Verification**: Ensure successful file creation

### File Operations

The system handles:
- **Documentation Files**: `.md` files in `docs/` directory
- **Rules Files**: `.mdc` files in `.cursor/rules/` directory
- **Code Files**: Appropriate extensions based on content
- **Data Files**: JSON, YAML, or CSV as needed

## Usage Examples

### Basic Documentation Generation

```python
# Execute documentation generation
result = mcp_traffic-sim-optimization_execute_prompt(
    prompt_id="generate_docs",
    input_data={
        "code_changes": "Description of changes",
        "context": "Project context"
    }
)
```

### Scaffolding Integration

```python
# Process output with scaffolding
scaffolding_result = mcp_traffic-sim-optimization_execute_prompt(
    prompt_id="agent_scaffolding_general",
    input_data={
        "tool_output": result,
        "tool_type": "generate_docs",
        "task_context": "Documentation generation"
    }
)
```

## Workflow Process

### 1. Content Generation
- Execute the `generate_docs` prompt
- Generate documentation content
- Return structured output

### 2. Output Processing
- Use scaffolding prompt to analyze output
- Determine required file operations
- Plan file creation strategy

### 3. File Operations
- Create appropriate files based on content type
- Ensure proper directory structure
- Validate file creation success

### 4. Verification
- Verify all files were created successfully
- Report any issues or errors
- Provide summary of operations

## Best Practices

### Content Generation
- Follow project documentation standards
- Include clear explanations and examples
- Maintain consistency with existing documentation
- Use proper markdown formatting

### File Operations
- Use descriptive, kebab-case filenames
- Follow project naming conventions
- Create directories as needed
- Handle errors gracefully

### System Integration
- Separate content generation from file operations
- Use scaffolding for output processing
- Implement proper error handling
- Monitor system performance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Files not created after prompt execution
**Solution**: Ensure scaffolding prompt is used to process output

**Issue**: Incorrect file paths or names
**Solution**: Check scaffolding prompt file naming strategy

**Issue**: Content formatting issues
**Solution**: Verify prompt template formatting requirements

### Performance Optimization

- Monitor prompt execution times
- Optimize scaffolding processing
- Cache frequently used templates
- Implement error recovery

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Advanced content type detection
- Automated file organization
- Enhanced error handling
- Performance monitoring

### Integration Opportunities
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Automated testing
- Content validation
- Quality assurance

## Conclusion

The MCP prompt management system with scaffolding provides a robust solution for automated documentation generation and file operations. The separation of concerns between content generation and file operations ensures maintainability and flexibility while providing reliable file creation capabilities.
