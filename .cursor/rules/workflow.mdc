# Development Workflow

- Dependency management with uv; use `uv sync --extra dev` before running.
- Common tasks:
  - `task setup` — sync environment
  - `task run` — run the simulator
  - `task test` — run tests with coverage
  - `task lint` / `task format` — static checks/formatting
  - `task precommit:install` — install pre-commit hooks
- CI uses uv; ensure tests pass locally before pushing to main.
- Keep commits small and focused; update tests alongside changes.
