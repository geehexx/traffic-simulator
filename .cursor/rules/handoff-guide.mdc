# Handoff Guide (Checkpoint)

- Start by reading [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](mdc:docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) and [docs/spec.md](mdc:docs/spec.md).
- Run with `uv sync --extra dev` then `uv run python -m traffic_sim`.
- Tests with `uv run python -m pytest` should be green.
- Next tasks: implement per-driver IDM params + jerk/lag, dynamic SSD with occlusion, and live HUD charts.
- Keep changes deterministic and add tests for new behavior.
