# Python Coding Standards

- Prefer clear, descriptive names; avoid 1â€“2 character variables.
- Keep units explicit in identifiers or docstrings where relevant (e.g., `_m`, `_kmh`).
- Maintain deterministic behavior in core simulation; randomness must be seedable via config.
- Do not hard-code pixel coordinates in core logic; convert world meters to pixels in the renderer.
- Use early returns for clarity and shallow nesting.
- Avoid catching exceptions without handling.
- Write tests for geometry/safety invariants when changing `track.py` or `simulation.py`.

Formatting/tools:
- Run `ruff` for lint checks and `black` for formatting via pre-commit.
- Keep line length at 100.
