# Agent Planning and Time Estimation Standards

## Planning Approach
- **Use realistic agent time estimates** rather than traditional developer time estimates
- **Break down complex tasks** into clear phases with specific deliverables
- **Provide accurate time estimates** for AI-assisted development

## Time Estimation Guidelines
- **Phase 1 (30 minutes)**: Major refactoring or new feature implementation
- **Phase 2 (15 minutes)**: Integration and testing of new components
- **Phase 3 (10 minutes)**: Bug fixes and minor improvements
- **Phase 4 (5 minutes)**: Documentation updates and cleanup

## Task Breakdown Standards
- **Clear deliverables**: Each phase should have specific, measurable outcomes
- **Realistic timelines**: Account for AI processing time and human review
- **Dependency management**: Identify and plan for task dependencies
- **Quality gates**: Include testing and validation in time estimates

## Communication Standards
- **Progress updates**: Regular status updates during long tasks
- **Risk identification**: Early warning of potential issues or delays
- **Stakeholder communication**: Clear updates on progress and blockers
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear records of decisions and changes

## Quality Assurance
- **Testing integration**: Include testing time in all estimates
- **Code review**: Account for review and feedback cycles
- **Documentation**: Plan time for updating relevant documentation
- **Validation**: Ensure deliverables meet acceptance criteria
