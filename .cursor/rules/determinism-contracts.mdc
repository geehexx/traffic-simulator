# Determinism Contracts

- Physics uses a fixed-step accumulator (`delta_t_s`); keep state updates independent of render timing.
- Single-vehicle case advances uniformly (no stochastic effects) to aid baseline tests.
- Randomness must be seeded via config:
  - Vehicle colors: `vehicles.color_random_seed` (independent RNG).
  - Driver sampling: `random.master_seed` (separate RNG).
- Time scaling: apply `speed_factor` only to the effective step size; do not change `delta_t_s`.
- Tests rely on these contracts; update or add tests if behavior changes.
