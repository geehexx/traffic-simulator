# Real-World Agent Example: Document Generation Workflow

This document shows a complete, realistic example of how an agent would naturally use the prompt management tools in a real scenario.

## üé¨ **Scenario: Improving Documentation Generation**

### **Initial Situation**
A user is working on a traffic simulator project and needs to generate comprehensive documentation for a new feature they've implemented. The current documentation generation isn't producing the quality they need.

## üìù **Step-by-Step Agent Workflow**

### **Step 1: User Request**
**User**: *"I just implemented a new collision detection system for the traffic simulator. Can you help me generate comprehensive documentation for it? The current documentation generation isn't giving me the detail I need."*

### **Step 2: Agent Analysis**
**Agent**: *"I'll help you generate better documentation for your collision detection system. Let me first check what documentation generation prompts we have available and see if we can optimize them for your specific needs."*

**Behind the scenes**: Agent uses `mcp_traffic-sim-optimization_list_prompts(tags=['docs'])` to see available documentation prompts.

### **Step 3: Prompt Assessment**
**Agent**: *"I found our documentation generation prompt. Let me evaluate its current performance to see how we can improve it for your collision detection documentation."*

**Behind the scenes**: Agent uses `mcp_traffic-sim-optimization_evaluate_performance('generate_docs')` to assess current performance.

### **Step 4: Optimization Decision**
**Agent**: *"The current prompt has a quality score of 0.88, but I can see it's not optimized for technical system documentation like collision detection. Let me run an optimization cycle to improve it specifically for technical documentation."*

**Behind the scenes**: Agent uses `mcp_traffic-sim-optimization_run_improvement_cycle('generate_docs', iterations=3)` to optimize the prompt.

### **Step 5: Human Review**
**Agent**: *"I've optimized the documentation prompt with a focus on technical systems. The new version shows a 15% improvement in quality score. Would you like me to show you the changes before I use it to generate your collision detection documentation?"*

**User**: *"Yes, show me what changed."*

**Agent**: *"Here are the key improvements made to the documentation prompt: [shows optimization results]. The new version includes better technical detail requirements, architecture explanations, and performance considerations - perfect for your collision detection system."*

### **Step 6: Documentation Generation**
**Agent**: *"Now I'll use the optimized prompt to generate comprehensive documentation for your collision detection system."*

**Behind the scenes**: Agent uses `mcp_traffic-sim-optimization_execute_prompt('generate_docs', {
    'code_changes': 'Implemented new collision detection system with spatial partitioning and event-driven scheduling',
    'context': 'This is a performance-critical system that handles vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-obstacle collisions in the traffic simulator'
})`

### **Step 7: Quality Review**
**Agent**: *"I've generated comprehensive documentation for your collision detection system. The documentation includes: [lists sections generated]. The optimized prompt produced much more detailed and technical documentation than the previous version. Would you like me to make any adjustments or generate additional sections?"*

### **Step 8: Feedback Integration**
**User**: *"This is much better! Can you make sure it also covers the performance implications and memory usage?"*

**Agent**: *"I'll update the prompt to specifically include performance and memory considerations for technical systems like this."*

**Behind the scenes**: Agent uses `mcp_traffic-sim-optimization_auto_optimize_feedback('generate_docs', {
    'quality_score': 0.95,
    'user_satisfaction': 0.9,
    'feedback': 'Include performance and memory considerations'
})`

### **Step 9: Continuous Improvement**
**Agent**: *"I've updated the prompt based on your feedback. The system will now automatically include performance and memory considerations in technical documentation. I've also set up monitoring so we can track how well the prompt performs over time and continue improving it."*

**Behind the scenes**: Agent uses `mcp_traffic-sim-optimization_configure_alerts()` to set up monitoring for the improved prompt.
