# Agent Prompt Workflows - Natural Language Examples

This document provides natural language examples of how agents will automatically recognize when to use prompt management tools and execute them seamlessly.

## üéØ **Initial Prompt Creation Workflow**

### **Agent Recognition Pattern**
When an agent encounters requests like:
- *"I need to create a prompt for generating API documentation"*
- *"We need a new prompt for code review feedback"*
- *"Create a prompt that helps with database schema design"*

### **Natural Language Execution**
The agent will automatically:
1. **Recognize the need** for a new prompt
2. **Use the MCP tool** to create it
3. **Provide the template** and metadata
4. **Test the prompt** with sample data

### **Example Workflow**
**User Request**: *"I need a prompt that generates comprehensive API documentation for our REST endpoints"*

**Agent Response**: *"I'll create a specialized prompt for API documentation generation. Let me set that up for you with the appropriate template and metadata."*

**Behind the scenes**: Agent uses `mcp_traffic-sim-optimization_create_prompt()` with:
- Template: "Generate comprehensive API documentation for the following REST endpoint..."
- Tags: ["api", "documentation", "rest"]
- Input schema for endpoint details

## üîÑ **Prompt Optimization Workflow**

### **Agent Recognition Pattern**
When an agent encounters:
- *"The documentation prompt isn't generating good results"*
- *"We need to improve the quality of our code review prompts"*
- *"The current prompt is too verbose, can we make it more concise?"*

### **Natural Language Execution**
The agent will automatically:
1. **Identify the prompt** that needs improvement
2. **Run optimization cycles** to improve performance
3. **Evaluate results** and iterate
4. **Deploy the optimized version**

### **Example Workflow**
**User Request**: *"Our documentation generation prompt is producing inconsistent results. Can we improve it?"*

**Agent Response**: *"I'll analyze the current prompt performance and run optimization cycles to improve the quality and consistency of the documentation generation."*

**Behind the scenes**: Agent uses:
- `mcp_traffic-sim-optimization_evaluate_performance()` to assess current state
- `mcp_traffic-sim-optimization_run_improvement_cycle()` for optimization
- `mcp_traffic-sim-optimization_optimize_prompt()` for targeted improvements

## üìä **Performance Monitoring Workflow**

### **Agent Recognition Pattern**
When an agent encounters:
- *"How are our prompts performing?"*
- *"Show me analytics on prompt usage and effectiveness"*
- *"Are there any prompts that need attention?"*

### **Natural Language Execution**
The agent will automatically:
1. **Check system status** and performance metrics
2. **Analyze prompt performance** across different metrics
3. **Identify optimization opportunities**
4. **Provide actionable recommendations**

### **Example Workflow**
**User Request**: *"Give me a dashboard view of how our prompts are performing"*

**Agent Response**: *"I'll pull up the current performance dashboard and analytics for all your prompts, showing usage patterns, effectiveness metrics, and optimization opportunities."*

**Behind the scenes**: Agent uses:
- `mcp_traffic-sim-optimization_get_dashboard()` for comprehensive overview
- `mcp_traffic-sim-optimization_get_analytics()` for detailed metrics
- `mcp_traffic-sim-optimization_get_status()` for system health

## üîß **Maintenance and Updates Workflow**

### **Agent Recognition Pattern**
When an agent encounters:
- *"Update the documentation prompt to include new requirements"*
- *"The code review prompt needs to focus more on security issues"*
- *"We need to add new tags to organize our prompts better"*

### **Natural Language Execution**
The agent will automatically:
1. **Identify the specific prompt** to update
2. **Modify the template** or metadata as needed
3. **Test the updated prompt** with sample data
4. **Commit changes** with proper versioning

### **Example Workflow**
**User Request**: *"The documentation prompt should also include security considerations and performance implications"*

**Agent Response**: *"I'll update the documentation generation prompt to include security and performance considerations in the requirements section."*

**Behind the scenes**: Agent uses:
- `mcp_traffic-sim-optimization_get_prompt()` to retrieve current version
- Updates the template with new requirements
- `mcp_traffic-sim-optimization_create_prompt()` to save the updated version

## ü§ù **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Workflow**

### **Agent Recognition Pattern**
When an agent encounters:
- *"I need to review the optimized prompt before deploying"*
- *"Can you show me the changes made during optimization?"*
- *"I want to approve the new prompt version"*

### **Natural Language Execution**
The agent will automatically:
1. **Present optimization results** for human review
2. **Show before/after comparisons** of prompt changes
3. **Request approval** for deployment
4. **Implement feedback** from human reviewers

### **Example Workflow**
**User Request**: *"Show me what changes were made to the documentation prompt during optimization"*

**Agent Response**: *"I'll show you the optimization results, including the original prompt, the optimized version, and the performance improvements achieved. You can review and approve the changes before deployment."*

**Behind the scenes**: Agent uses:
- `mcp_traffic-sim-optimization_get_prompt()` to show current version
- Presents optimization history and performance metrics
- Requests human approval before deploying changes

## üöÄ **Deployment and Production Workflow**

### **Agent Recognition Pattern**
When an agent encounters:
- *"Deploy the optimized prompts to production"*
- *"Make the new prompt version active"*
- *"Rollback to the previous version if needed"*

### **Natural Language Execution**
The agent will automatically:
1. **Deploy optimized prompts** to production environment
2. **Set up monitoring** for the new versions
3. **Configure alerts** for performance issues
4. **Provide rollback options** if needed

### **Example Workflow**
**User Request**: *"Deploy the optimized documentation prompt to production and set up monitoring"*

**Agent Response**: *"I'll deploy the optimized prompt to production, configure monitoring and alerts, and ensure you have rollback options if needed."*

**Behind the scenes**: Agent uses:
- `mcp_traffic-sim-optimization_deploy_prompts()` for production deployment
- `mcp_traffic-sim-optimization_configure_alerts()` for monitoring setup
- Provides deployment status and rollback instructions

## üìà **Continuous Improvement Workflow**

### **Agent Recognition Pattern**
When an agent encounters:
- *"Set up automated optimization for our prompts"*
- *"Configure feedback collection for prompt improvement"*
- *"Enable continuous learning for our prompt system"*

### **Natural Language Execution**
The agent will automatically:
1. **Set up automated optimization cycles** for continuous improvement
2. **Configure feedback collection** mechanisms
3. **Enable performance monitoring** and alerting
4. **Schedule regular optimization** runs

### **Example Workflow**
**User Request**: *"Set up our prompt system for continuous improvement with automated optimization"*

**Agent Response**: *"I'll configure automated optimization cycles, set up feedback collection, and enable continuous monitoring to ensure your prompts keep improving over time."*

**Behind the scenes**: Agent uses:
- `mcp_traffic-sim-optimization_configure_alerts()` for monitoring setup
- `mcp_traffic-sim-optimization_run_improvement_cycle()` for automated optimization
- `mcp_traffic-sim-optimization_auto_optimize_feedback()` for feedback-based improvement
